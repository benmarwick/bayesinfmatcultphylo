The output files from RevBayes (.out, log, .nex, .trees, etc.) are not stored with
the GitHub repo because some of them are too large to push to GitHub (>100 MB).

In this folder they were originally labelled output-001, output-002, etc. Then 
zipped together into a file called revbayes-output.zip. This zip file can be 
found at https://osf.io/rbqa5/ To recreate the original directory structure, 
unzip revbayes-output.zip into this derived_data/ folder.

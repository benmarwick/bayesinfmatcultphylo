## Contents

The **analysis** directory contains:

- [:file_folder: paper](/analysis/paper): Quarto source document for
  manuscript. Includes code to reproduce the figures and tables
  generated by the analysis. It also has a rendered version,
  `paper.docx`, suitable for reading (the code is replaced by figures
  and tables in this file)
- [:file_folder: data](/analysis/data): Data used in the analysis.
- [:file_folder: figures](/analysis/figures): Plots and other
  illustrations

## How to run in your browser or download and run locally

This research compendium has been developed using the statistical
programming language R. To work with the compendium, you will need
installed on your computer the [R
software](https://cloud.r-project.org/) itself and optionally [RStudio
Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

You can download the compendium as a zip from from this URL:
[master.zip](https://github.com/benmarwick/bayesinfmatcultphylo/archive/master.zip).
After unzipping: - open the `.Rproj` file in RStudio.  
- run `renv::restore` to ensure you have the packages this analysis
depends on (also listed in the [DESCRIPTION](/DESCRIPTION) file).  
- to re-run the code that performs the data analysis and creates the
visualisations, look in the `scripts` folder and run the R and Rev
script files in order. The file names contain numbers that indicate the
correct order (eg. 001, 002, etc.). You will need to install
[RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io/) to run some of these files.  
- The data analysis took about 10 hours on my Macbook Pro 2.3 GHz Core
i7 with 16 Gb RAM. The full output files were too large to commit to
GitHub, and so are stored on [OSF](https://osf.io/rbqa5/). If you want
to skip running the entire analysis, especially the time-consuming MCMC
runs, you can find the analysis output at <https://osf.io/rbqa5/> in a
folder called `revbayes-output`, and use that to run some of the later
steps - finally, open `analysis/paper/paper.qmd` and render to produce
the `paper.docx`, or run
`quarto::quarto_render("analysis/paper/paper.qmd")` in the R console.
Note that this file does not run any analysis code, it only combines the
previously generated figures with the text of the manuscript to generate
the manuscript.
